It is a Raspberry Pi based AI system to identify the weight of
potatoes without measuring them physically. The Raspberry Pi
bases AI system can measure the weight of potato just by
taking a picture of it. The system uses pre-trained model called
Inception V3 developed by Google. In our case, the model will
is retrained for its last layer with labels of input images based
on what it previously learnt which is popularly known as
transfer learning. The system comprises of open source
technology like python, inception model and Raspberry Pi.
